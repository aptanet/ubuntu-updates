# ubuntu-updates

This is a script written in Bash that runs through the vairous commands used on Ubuntu to install updates and keep things tidy. It allows each stage to be skipped and tries to keep you informed of what it is going to do at key stages. It isn't rocket science, but saves a decent amount of typing. It needs to be run with sudo to get the necessary privileges.
